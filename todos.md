## Critical Issues

2. **Type Safety Issues**:
   - In extension.ts, non-null assertions (`!`) are used for configuration values without proper fallbacks:
   ```typescript
   logFilePath = config.get<string>('logFilePath')!;
   logFile = config.get<string>('logFile')!;
   ```
   Consider providing fallbacks.

3. **Missing Error Handling**:
   - The file read operation lacks proper error handling:
   ```typescript
   const logContent = fs.readFileSync(logPath, 'utf8');
   ```
   Consider using try/catch or checking file existence first.

## Code Improvements

1. **Inconsistent Repository Handling**:
   - The `activeRepos.forEach` callback function lacks proper type annotations, using `any` type.
   ```typescript
   activeRepos.forEach((repo: { state: { HEAD: { commit: any; name: any; }; onDidChange: (arg0: () => void) => void; }; rootUri: { fsPath: any; }; }) => {
   ```
   Consider defining a proper interface.

2. **Duplicate Configuration Access**:
   - Configuration is read multiple times throughout the code. Consider centralizing config access.

3. **Hardcoded Log File Reference**:
   - There's a hardcoded reference to 'commits.log' in the log message:
   ```typescript
   logInfo('Commit details logged to commits.log');
   ```
   Should use the configured `logFile` variable.

4. **Inconsistent Commit Processing**:
   - The `lastProcessedCommit` is fetched from global state but not used for filtering.

## Architectural Suggestions

1. **Separate Repository Management**:
   - Consider creating a dedicated class for repository management rather than handling everything in the activation function.

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Create a centralized configuration service that handles validation, updates, and provides access to settings.

3. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Define proper interfaces for the VS Code Git API to avoid using `any` types.

4. **Unit Test Coverage**:
   - There appear to be no tests for core functionality like commit tracking and logging.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient File Handling**:
   - Reading the entire log file to check for commit existence could be inefficient for large logs.
   - Consider using a more efficient approach such as a cache or database.

2. **Debounce Settings**:
   - The debounce time of 300ms might need adjustment based on user feedback.
