Based on this implementation plan, let's implement the next part of Phase 4: Service Refinement - Create any other needed services.

Please review extension.ts.bak, RepositoryManager.ts.bak, commandManager.ts gitService.ts.bak and gitService.ts to ensure we're not losing any functionality.

Any updates for the Reposiroty Manager will go in repositoryManager.ts. RepositoryManager.ts.bak is the old file which includes all the functionality. Please cross-reference to ensure we're not missing anything.

gitService.ts.bak is the old file that includes all the gitService commands. gitService.ts is the new file.

Please only show the code that needs to be updated and where to update it, instead of outputting the entire file.

Based on this implementation plan, let's implement the next part of Phase 4a: Create LogService

Already partially implemented but needs to be enhanced and standardized
Should handle all logging operations throughout the application
Will replace direct calls to logInfo and logError
Please review extension.ts.bak, RepositoryManager.ts.bak, commandManager.ts gitService.ts.bak and gitService.ts to ensure we're not losing any functionality.

Integration Strategy For each service:

Create service interface in /services/interfaces
Implement default service implementation in /services
Update ExtensionManager to provide these services
Refactor existing code to use the new services
Ensure proper unit tests for isolated functionality
Cross-Cutting Concerns

Use dependency injection pattern consistently
Design for testability with interfaces/mocks
Add optional caching where appropriate
Maintain a clear separation of concerns
