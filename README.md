# Commit Tracker for Visual Studio Code

üöß **Work in Progress** üöß

**Commit Tracker** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to simplify Git commit tracking by logging commit details to a configurable file and optionally pushing changes to a remote repository. This extension is currently under development and may not be fully functional.

## Features (Planned & In-Progress)

- **Log File Path Configuration**: Set the directory and file where commit details will be saved.
- **Automatic Commit Logging**: Track commit details, including:
  - Commit hash
  - Commit message
  - Timestamp
  - Branch name
  - Repository path
- **Excluded Branches**: Allow users to skip logging for specified branches.
- **Push Changes to Remote**: Automatically push the updated log file to the repository (coming soon).
- **Debounced Monitoring**: Efficient tracking to prevent performance degradation in large repositories.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Basic commit tracking and logging are implemented.**
- ‚úÖ **Push to remote functionality implemented.**
- ‚úÖ **Improved error handling and retry logic implemented.**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Scalability for large monorepos and multi-repo setups under development.**
